# Getting Started

Before you can start trading, you must first own the base currency \(USDT\) used as margin to trade in the derivative market.

Afterwards, you should find an active derivative market that you would like to participate in.

Then, set the ERC-20 approval of the base currency token set to the futures contract address.

TODO: add pictures and walkthroughs for this process.
